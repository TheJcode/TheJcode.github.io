Before we get to the meat of my post, I want to mention how I got started in web development. My beginnings originated as a preteen developing themes for Myspace.com using notepad. From there my passion grew and grew. I loved and still to this day love how creative the web allows people to be. 

This post will be updated again next week with pictures and details.

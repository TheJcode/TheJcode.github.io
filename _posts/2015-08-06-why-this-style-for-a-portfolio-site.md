title: "Why This Style for a Portfolio Site?"
---

For me the answer lies in my goals for the website, the design process and user feedback. Before going forward, let me describe the type of user I am. Being upfront and honest I'm a lazy user. I prefer things intuitive, features out in the open, and optimally designed with a story telling experience. Subtleties matter. I don't like to struggle looking for features or need an in depth explanation on how to find things. 

Now, how does being a lazy user translate into a great not lazy designer? 

As a designer, my first priority is to define the user and then keep them in mind every step of the way. Next comes a mixture of clarifying features and thoughts on how I can present them to the user in a sleek minimalist design. Finally, I bring in technical skills to build the vision.  

####Goal for this website####
First I started with a blank slate. The original goal for this website was to simply have a portfolio site. To me, prior to doing research, having a portfolio site meant a place to display my work. After looking at other portfolios and thinking about my audience, the vision became even more clear. The primary question that helped shape my goal was: how will this portfolio site exist in conjunction with my other pieces of social media to tell an accurate story about who I am? With that thought in the forefront, the goal focus evolved from the original goal to being -

Develop a site that exist as an insight to my design process and thoughts on various practices within the industries.  

Those industries are web development/design, UI/UX and cyber security. With that goal in mind even more questions sprang forth about the design. 

####The questions I asked####
These are the questions I asked myself from start to finish at various parts of the design process. 

* What pieces of information should I include on my site?
* Who is the audience
* How long will the audience be on my site?
* What should I use to put my blog together? 
* How will this website fit among my other pieces of social media?
* How can I tell the story of who I am?
* How can I evoke feelings from the user?
* What color gray should I use to be easy on the eyes?
* What font type should I use to provide easy reading?
* What color should the background be? 
* What UI principles will I use?
* Is the website mobile friendly?
* Where should certain pieces of information go to be optimally displayed?
* Am I asking the right questions? 

To answer these questions in design, I made sketches. 

####The sketches####

As you can see I went through multiple revisions for this site (and not all of them are up here) before deciding to move forward with coding and a touch of my personality. Every bit of this site has taken into consideration the user's experience to enjoy their time on my portfolio site and learn more about me in the process. 

####The end.####

My design process can be summarized as define website goal. look at other portfolios. Gather information. Research best current UI & UX practices. Sketch website. Ask questions about the site from a user perspective. redesign. get feedback. redesign. redesign. ask more questions. gather feedback. redesign some more.

Ultimately, the purpose of this blog is to allow other people to know me better as a designer and a developer.
